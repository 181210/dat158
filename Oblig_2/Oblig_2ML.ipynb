    "##### In 2013 Kaggle hosted the original dogs versus cats challenge as a for-fun competition. Rumour has it that the lack of an online coding environment lead to approached sharing by scratching primitive glpyhs on cave walls with sticks and sharp objects. Now the classification problem is reintroduced back on Kaggle as a playground competition with kernels enabled. Although modern techniques may make light of this once-difficult problem, it is through practice of new techniques on old datasets that we will make light of machine learning's future challenges.\n",

    "##### The rule is simple: The train folder contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename. The test folder contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id. For each image in the test set, you should predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat)."

    "##### This model is based on binary classification of dog and cat images. Transferred learning to another binary classification project could be applicable. The obvious weakness is that if the model is presented with a photo that is not of either a dog or a cat its limitation would classify it as one or another due to the architecture of the network. If it's not a dog, it's a cat and vice verca. "
